Object Recognition
==================

A prototype of an object recognition system using OpenCV/Kinect camera. This software was created as part of a larger proof of concept project. Most of the project itself involved researching popular computer vision algorithms and technologies at the time (2012). The project also involved an industry partner ([Dynamic Controls](https://dynamiccontrols.com)).

This prototype is able to identify particular known objects in video frames. However, please note, it is nowhere near the performance of CNNs found today!
